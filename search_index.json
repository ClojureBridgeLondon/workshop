To move a page forwards or backwards use the right or left arrow keys, or press the arrows at the side of each page (or bottom of the page if on a small display).\n\nEvaluating Clojure\nYou can try out Clojure code directly in the pages of this workshop.  The code boxes below allow you to edit the code in the top of the box, with the results evaluated automatically and updated in the results in the bottom of the box.\n(defn live-evaluation [opinion]\n  (str &quot;Clojure live evaluation is... &quot; opinion))\n\n(live-evaluation &quot;awesomenessness&quot;)\n\nThese code boxes are powered by a ClojureScript library called Klipse.\n Klipse HintsAlternatively you may use Klipse as a stand-alone editor or as a stand-alone editor with Javascript outputKlipse can evaluate code from a public Github Gists\nExercises\nExercises are denoted by using the Note callout plugin for gitbook.  Exercises look like:\n Create a Clojure projectUse the Leiningen tool to create a project called clojure-is-awesomenessness\nThere are other callout styles available, including: Info, Hint, Warning, Tag, Comment, Success, Caution, Quote and Danger.\nAnswers\nSuggested answers are included directly in the workshop in hidden sections.

Some of the other languages you might have heard of (or will hear of!) are C, JavaScript, Python, and Java.\nSo why are we teaching Clojure?\nWe&apos;re using Clojure because of three qualities it has which make it an ideal first language to learn, or a great language to learn in addition to others you might already know.\nClojure is simple\nClojure is simple. That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s not powerful; it is. The number of concepts you have to know to program in Clojure is very small, however, and easy to grasp.\nClojure grows with you as you learn it, and you can be very productive with a small subset of the language.\nSimple is also more easier to manage in the long term.\nIf you imagine building roads, some have to be twisty and complex.  Each time someone drives down these roads it is harder than driving on a straight road.\n\n\nClojure is all-purpose\nClojure is all-purpose. Some languages have a specific focus.\nJavaScript, for example, was traditionally used only in web pages (although that&apos;s changed somewhat).\nObjective-C and Swift are used mainly for iPhone and other Apple apps.\nWe&apos;re going to make a drawing application today, but you can use Clojure for any sort of application easily.\n\n\nClojure is Fun\nClojure is fun.\nThat&apos;s a matter of opinion, of course, but we think it holds true. I hope that during this course you experience the joy of seeing a Clojure program come together and do something powerful and surprising.\n\nKlipse for Kids\n\n\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"introducing-clojure/who-uses-clojure.html":{"url":"introducing-clojure/who-uses-clojure.html","title":"Who uses Clojure","body":"Who Uses Clojure\nThere are many companies using Clojure as either their main development language or for building specific applications and services.  Here are just a few examples from the UK.  Further examples are discussed in the Clojure in... series by JUXT\n\n\nSignal Media is a machine learning company extracting knowledge from 3 million documents a day from newspapers, magazines, broadcasts, and online publications.\nEach piece of content needs to be understood: what it is about? Who is being mentioned? Is it &#39;apple&#39; the fruit or Apple the company? Is it the Trump company being mentioned or the Donald Trump presidency? To face up against these challenges\nSignal uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand the context of information, eg. if apple is mentioned, is it the fruit or the company?.\nSignal perform spam detection (filtering), language detection and translation (40 different languages from 90 different countries) anomaly detection and sentiment analysis.  The results made searchable so you can ask questions like: Show me all the tweets and blog posts about Clojure.\n\n\nProcesses large volumes of data from financial services, insurance companies to drive their price comparison website.\nuSwitch is a major supporter of the London Clojurian Community having used Clojure since it&#39;s early 1.0 days. They run regular coding dojos at their offices for newcomers to the language, and sponsor various community events and conferences (such as EuroClojure, ClojureBridge, and the Clojure Exchange). They frequently commit to open-source Clojure libraries and have also participated in the annual Clojure Cup.\nThe revolution at uSwitch began in 2010 after the company was acquired by Forward Internet Group. uSwitch&#39;s .NET monolithic systems were strangled and subsequently replaced with a system of microservices, written in Clojure, Ruby, Go and more.\nAs with the changes to technology, the organisation also transformed from being functionally structured to product-oriented; decoupling the business to make it more resilient and easier to scale.\n\n\nHealthUnlocked created a social network centred around chronic health conditions. Their users share 4.5 pieces of health content every minute across this network. Using the Clojure tooling they created, this information is classified into 700 different categories within milliseconds.\nMachine learning is applied the experiences shared by their users to information they need to better manage their own health.\nNetworks are operated by charities and patient groups.  HealthUnlocked simply provides the tools for these organisations to manage their communities.\n\n\nMetail provides online tools to the fashion industry.  With just 5 measurements customers can see what clothes will look like using accurate 3D avatars of their body shape.\nMachine learning and data science services make recommendations and give fashion advice, whilst being able to feed data back to the clothes producers as to improve cuts and sizing. Their software is delivered to online retailers across the globe, including India, Korea, Thailand and Europe.\nMetail uses Clojure for their RESTful API services and ClojureScript on the front-end. They maintain a Metail tech blog and host a variety of meet-ups at their offices such as Data Insights Cambridge, Cambridge AWS User Group, and Cambridge NonDysFunctional Programmers. Metail also sponsored this year&#39;s /dev/summer.\n\n\nCiti Group is the largest financial company in the world employing 220 million people across the world.

Why is your code doing what it is doing.\nIn Clojure a comment is started by the character: ;\nClojure ignores any line that starts with ;, so comments are purely for the developers working with the code.\nWhen we write code, we try to make it as clear as possible.  This helps others understand what was written quickly.  Sometimes we can do this without comments, sometimes comments are very useful.\n HintDevelopers often come back to code they wrote themselves a while ago and realise they have forgotten Why code.\n;; simple examples of functions to intrigue you for the next few pages\n(str &quot;Hello&quot; &quot; &quot; &quot;World!&quot;)   ; a well-known hello world example\n(+ 3 4)                      ; why is this not written as 3 + 4?\n\nComments style\nIn Clojure, comments can be started with a semicolon.

This is called prefix notation. What you&#39;re used to seeing is called infix notation, as the arithmetic operator is in-between the two operands.\nLanguages such as JavaScript use infix notation, while Clojure only uses prefix notation.\nPrefix notation is useful for many reasons. Look at this example of an infix expression and the prefix equivalent:\nInfix:  1 + 2 * 3 / 4 + 5 - 6 * 7 / 8 + 9\n\nPrefix: (+ (- (+ (+ 1 (/ (* 2 3) 4)) 5) (/ (* 6 7) 8)) 9)\n\nThe benefits of prefix notation\nImagine both the above expressions are unclear.  However in the prefix version you do not have to ever think about the precedence of operators.\nBecause each expression has the operator before all the operands and the entire expression is wrapped in parentheses, all precendence is explicit.\nInfix:  1 + 2 / 3\nPrefix: (+ 1 (/ 2 3))\n\nLess repetitive\nAnother reason prefix notation can be nice is that it can make long\nexpressions less repetitive.\nWith prefix notation, if we plan to use the same operator on many\noperands, we do not have to repeat the operator between them.\nInfix:  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9\nPrefix: (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"simple-values/strings.html":{"url":"simple-values/strings.html","title":"Strings","body":"Strings\nA string is any numbers, letters or special characters surrounded with double quotation marks, &quot;&quot;.\n\nReference: String\n\nExample strings\n&quot;Hello, World!&quot;\n&quot;This is a longer string that I wrote for purposes of an example.&quot;\n&quot;Aubrey said, \\&quot;I think we should go to the Orange Julius.\\&quot;&quot;\n\nIn the last example a backslash, \\, is used to allow us to put special characters inside a string.\nWorking with strings\nThere are many functions that work with strings\n\nstr - join values into a string\nsplit - split a string based on a pattern (regex)\nsubs - get part of a string\nreplace - replace part of the string based on a pattern (regex)\nincludes? - does a string include another string (true or false)\n\n Create a String of favourite coloursUse a function to create one string containing the names and favourite colours of each person in the group()\n\n\n Does the string contain your favorite colourUse one of the functions above to see if a string contains a colourFor example, does the string &quot;Richard of York gave brown bread in vans&quot; contain the colour brown()\n\n\n HintBe careful if you copy/pasting Clojure code from a website that uses the stylised double quotes.

 "},"additional-projects/celebrity-name-smash.html":{"url":"additional-projects/celebrity-name-smash.html","title":"Celebrity Name Smash","body":"celebrity-name-smash\nTake celebrity names and smash them together to create weird and wonderful gestalt version of them.\nTo understand how this code was created, read the article Clojure Dojo: Celebrity Name Smash - June 2016\n Break the celebrity name smash challenge into several sections\nThe June 2016 edition of the London Clojurians coding dojo set the challenge of building a celebrity name smash, taking two &quot;celebrities&quot; and smashing their names together to make a weird or ammusing gestalt name.\nFor bonus points the challenge would include this celebrity name smash as a service and even more bonus points if using the new clojure.spec library to put specifications around data structures and functions.\n\nBonus points are non-redeemable, sorry!\n\nAlthough our group didnt get get any of the bonus levels, here is the blow by blow development of our code for the Celebrity Name Smash.\n\n\nA simple leiningen project to start\nWe created a default Clojure project to start using the following leiningen command\nlein new celebrity-name-smash\nThis created a simple project using Clojure 1.8.0.  If we had chosen to use clojure.spec as well then we would have updated the project.clj file to use Clojure 1.9.x as a dependency instead.\nModeling the Celebrities\nThe simplest way to represent a celebrity name is in a string.  So we bount a name called celebrities to a string containing the first celebrity we could think of\n(def celbrties &quot;Brad Pitt&quot;)\n\nAs we want to have two celebrties then we changed the data structure into a Clojure vector.  A vector is the most flexible data structure in Clojure.  So we redefined the name celebrities to be bound to a vector of strings containing the first celebrity couple we could think of.\n(def celebrities [&quot;Brad Pitt&quot; &quot;Angelina Jolie&quot;])\n\nSplitting names\nEach celebrity has a first and last name, so we need to split them into individual strings first.\n\nWe decided to exclude celebrities with just a single name.\n\nFrom a quick Google we found the clojure.string/split function that will split a string on a given pattern, that pattern being a regular expression (regex).\n(clojure.string/split &quot;Clojure is awesome!&quot; #&quot; &quot;)\n\n;; =&gt; [&quot;Clojure&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;awesome!&quot;]\n\nThe regular expression pattern &quot; &quot; matches the space characters.  We could have also used #&quot;+s&quot; for the same results in this example, although it was felt that the space was clearer in intent.\nSo we wrote a function called name-split to take a first and last name as a string and return two seperate strings, one for the first name and one for the last name.\n(defn name-split\n  &quot;Splits a celebrity name into their first &amp; last names&quot;\n  [name]\n  (str/split name #&quot; &quot;))\n\nWe tested the name-split function in the repl\n(name-split &quot;Brad Pitt&quot;)\n\n;; =&gt;[&quot;Brad&quot; &quot;Pitt&quot;]\n\nWe could now succesfully split the full name of a celebrity into their first and last names.\n\nA more advanced example of splitting up words would be to use re-seq with a regex patter, as in the HHGTTG book processing example in clojure-through-code.\n\nCreating sub-strings of names the long way\nAs the aim of our code is to create silly and weird names from celebrity names, we wont get the desired results with just the first and last names.  So we take those and split them.\nAt first we decided to split them in half, rounding down for odd lenght names.\nAs a Clojure String can be used like a collection of characters, we could simply take the first x number of characters.\n(take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r)\n\nThe value returned is a list of characters, so we would have to combine them back into a string.  Just using the str function on the result of the take function returned a lazy sequence.  To get a string we needed to apply or reduce with the str function\n;; (str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;clojure.lang.LazySeq@c31&quot;\n\n(apply str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))   ;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n(reduce str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))  ;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\nTo do this for a name of any length we would need to count the string characters and divide by 2.\n(take (/ (count &quot;Brad&quot;) 2) &quot;Brad&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count &quot;Brad&quot;) 2) &quot;Brad&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\nThis code also works for names that have an odd number of characters.  When the odd number of characters is divided by two, a Clojure ratio type is used to hold the result rather than return a decimal value.  The take function calculated the value of the ratio type and rounds it to the nearest whole number.\nHere is a breakdown of how this code works with a name containing an odd number of characters.\n(count &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; 7\n\n(/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2)\n;; =&gt; 7/2\n\n(take (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2) &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r \\a \\d)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2) &quot;Bradley&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brad&quot;\n\nCreating sub-strings the short way\nAfter reviewing this code it seemed a little complex for what we wanted, so a quick Google gave us the subs function.  The subs function takes a string and a starting point for the split, with an optional end point\n(subs &quot;Brad&quot; 0 2)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\n(subs &quot;Brad&quot; 2)\n;; =&gt; &quot;ad&quot;\n\n(subs &quot;Bradley&quot; 0 (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Bra&quot;\n\nSo when we want the first part of the name we give the subs function a start point and an end point for the sub-division.  For the last part of a name we simply give the start point for the sub-division.\n\nHint If the take or subs function did not deal with odd numbers of characters, then instead of dividing by 2 we could have used the quot function.  The quote function divides the first argument by the second argument, returning the result as a whole number.\n\nCreating a subname function for the first name\nWe created a function that takes the name as a argument and returns the substring for the first half of the name\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (/ (count name) 2)]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\n;; calling the function with an odd lenght name\n(first-celeb-subname &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Bra&quot;\n\nWe used the let function to create a local name (symbol) called end that points to the end position in the string, based on dividing the name by 2.  Then we call the subs fuction to get the substring from 0 to the value of end.\nCreating a more random sub-name function\nJust talking the half way point for our substring only gives one result.  If we add a random element to creating our substring then we should get many more variations in results.\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (+ 1 (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA slight refinement can be made by replacing + 1 with the inc function\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA subname function for the second celebrity\nWe wanted to combine two first names and two last names to make a new first &amp; last name.  So we need a similar function to create the lastname subname\n(defn last-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [start (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name start)))\n\nThis function is almost identical to the first function, however only a start position is provided to subs function, creating a substring from the start position to the end of the name.\nPutting it all together\nFinally we call these functions from a main function named celeb-name-smash, which takes two celebrity names as string arguments and returns a string containing the smashed name.\n(defn celeb-name-smash\n  &quot;Smashes to celebrity names together&quot;\n  [celeb-one celeb-two]\n  (str (first-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-two)))\n       &quot; &quot;\n       (first-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-two)))))\n\n;; call the celeb-name-smash function with example data\n(name-smash-strings &quot;Brad Pitt&quot; &quot;Angelina Jolie&quot;)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brana Pitie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brelina Pie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brelina Piolie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brlina Pi&quot;\n\nThe celeb-name-smash function has a lot of duplication, so should probably be refactored to make it more elegant.  However, we ran out of time at the dojo, so I will have a look at refactoring this function as homework.\nT\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"additional-projects/clacks-messages.html":{"url":"additional-projects/clacks-messages.html","title":"Clack Messeges","body":"Clacks Messages - encoding and decoding text messages\n Covert clacks messages into multiple pages\nAt the March 2016 London Clojurians code dojo at uSwitch our group created a Clacks Interpreter in honor of Terry Pratchett, the author of the amazing Discworld series of books (and a few TV shows of those books too).\nIn the 33rd Discworld novel called Going Postal, messages are sent faster than a speeding horse via the Clacks system.  This composes of a series of towers that cross a continent and pass messages on via combinations of lights.  Each tower sees a grid of lights from a distant tower and sends the message on to the next tower.\n\nThe Clacks system was actually introduced in the 24th Discworld novel called &quot;The Fith Elephant&quot;, however its the &quot;Going Postal&quot; book where we learn the full history of the Clacks system.\n\nWe created a Clacks Interpreter that converts any English message into its corresponding clacks signal, based on the Clacks alphabet as defined by the board game of the same name.  The board game defines the alphabet as a 2 by 3 grid (although in the Discworld its actually 8 large squares).  Naturally, the interpreter also converts the Clacks signal back into an English message too.\n\nThe code is available on Github at: https://github.com/liamjtaylor/clacks-messenger and read on for a walk through of how we came up with the solution.\n\nThe Challenge\nWe wanted to be able to take any English language messages and transmit it across the clacks network, then\nRepresenting a Clack\nFor each clack, we read the pattern from the top of the first column to the botton, then from the top of the second column to the bottom.  A light in a position represents a 1 value and no light represents a 0 value.  This gives us our 6 number pattern for each clack in the alphabet.\nDeciding the data structure\nThe initial data structure chosen was essentially just modelling each individual clack.  Since a clack is a 2x3 structure, the simplest way to represent a clacks is to have a vector that contains 2 vectors, each with three elements.\nSo a simple expression of the letter a in the clacks alphabet would be:\n[[0 1 0][0 0 1]]\n\nTherefore we could define a single letter of our alphabet as follows:\n(def a [[0 1 0][0 0 1]])\n\nBefore we define the complete alphabet using this data structure, lets test if we have the right data structure for our conversion process.\nTesting a simple conversion with our data structure\nLets try the simplest way to convert a character into a clack:\n(defn character-&gt;clack [character]\n  (if (= character &quot;a&quot;)\n    a\n    (str &quot;Sorry, character is not yet in the alphabet, please create a pull request&quot;)))\n\nCalling the function converts a string into the corresponding clack\n(character-&gt;clack &quot;a&quot;)\n\nAlthough the code is simple for 1 character, it does hightlight the problem of converting the whole alphabet.  We would need either a deeply nested set of if statements or a very long case statement, neither of which seems to be a particularly functional approach or idiomatic Clojure.\nEven if we did use a case statement, how would we convert a clack back into a character?\nSo perhaps we need to change the data structure, one that provides an easy way to map to values together.\nAlso, there seems no value in mapping values to a 2x3 grid as long as we consistently express a clack.\nDefining the alphabet with a map\nA map data structure in Clojure is a hash map (a key &amp; value paring) for example I could define myself as a map\n{:name &quot;john&quot; :age &quot;21&quot; :twitter &quot;jr0cket&quot;}\n\nIts very common to use Clojure keywords for the keys, to make it easy to look up a particular value by refering to the keyword.\nSo the new design for our clacks data structure is as follows\n{:a [0 1 0 0 0 1]}\n\nTo help with testing this new data structure desing, we crated enough letters of the clacks alphabet to make some simple words, i.e bat\n(def alphabet {:a [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n               :b [0 0 1 0 1 0]\n               :t [1 0 0 1 1 1]})\n\nTesting the map design\nWe can use the keyword to lookup the value of its clack code\n(alphabet :a)\n\n;; =&gt; [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n\nThen we created a simple function to convert a string to a sequence of clacks\n(defn character-&gt;clack [letter]\n  (if (= letter &quot;a&quot;)\n    (alphabet :a)\n    (str &quot;Sorry, character is not yet in the alphabet, please create a pull request&quot;)))\n\n\nThe -&gt; character is part of the function name.  This is a Clojure naming convention used when the function you are defining converts from one type to another.\n\nAnd call the function as follows\n(character-&gt;clack &quot;a&quot;)\n\n;; =&gt; [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n\nConverting a word\nNow we want to convert a whole word to a clacks sequence.  It seemed the easiest way to convert a whole word was to convert each letter at a time using the map to look up each clack code, returning all the clacks codes in a sequence.\nSo we redefined the string-&gt;clacks function to take in a whole word.\nWe used the map function to apply a conversion function over each element in the word (each element of the string).  This conversion function called clacksify.\n(defn clacksify [letter]\n  (let [character (str letter)]\n  (alphabet (keyword character))))\n\n(defn string-&gt;clacks [word]\n  (map clacksify word))\n\nNow we could convert any workd that used the letters of our limted alphabet.  We chose bat as a simple word.\n(string-&gt;clacks &quot;bat&quot;)\n\n\nAs we are passing a string and not a keyword to the clacksify function, then we first convert the string to a keyword using the keyword function.\n\nConverting the clack to a string\nIs there a simple way to look up a key given a value that is unique in the map?\nAll Clack codes are unique in the map, but there did not seem to be a simple expression to find the key when given a value.\nWe could have created a second mapping, however having two maps seemed redundant and a potential cause for silly bugs.\nThe answer was simple once we found it.  As the clack codes are unique, they could be used as keys for the letter values, we just needed to swap the map around.  Swapping a map&apos;s keys and values was done by writing a reverse-map function.\n(defn reverse-map\n  &quot;Reverse the keys and value pairs in a map.\n  Allows the map to be used to convert from a clack to a letter without defining a second map&quot;\n  [m]\n  (into {} (map (fn [[a b]] [b a]) m)))\n\nSo we defined the function declacksify which takes a clack code and returns its corresponding character.  The clack code returns the corresponding keyword rather than a character, so we use the name function to convert the keyword into a character name.\n(defn declacksify [clack]\n  (name ((reverse-map alphabet) clack)))\n\n(defn clacks-&gt;string [clacks]\n  (map declacksify clacks))\n\nSo calling these functions with a clacks\n(declacksify  [1 0 0 1 1 1])\n;; =&gt; &quot;t&quot;\n\n(clacks-&gt;string [[0 0 1 0 1 0] [0 1 0 0 0 1] [1 0 0 1 1 1]])\n;; =&gt; (&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;t&quot;)\n\n\nIts probably at this point we should have realised that we didnt need to use keywords to represent the characters of the alphabet.  In fact, using keywords made a little more work for us.\n\nTyding up the output\nOur clacks-&gt;string function returns the right result, but not quite in the format we want.  Rather than a single string, we get the individual characters.\nUsing the reduce function we can apply the str function over the resulting characters to give a single string.  So our function becomes\n(defn clacks-&gt;string [clacks]\n(map str (map declacksify clacks)))\n\nWorking with another language\nThanks to a flexible design with no side effects or side causes then its really easy to replace the English language alphabet with another language that can be encoded into Clack codes.  So languages based on the greek, latin or cyrilic alphabet could be send if a suitable alphabet with clack codes is supplied.\nSummary\nWe were quite happy with the code produced in this dojo.  The code is pretty readable we believe and we have taken a fairly simple approach to the design.  In hindsight we could have made the code even easier if we had tested out the map data structure a little more and used a string character for each letter in the alphabet.\nWorking in an editor attached to a REPL worke well (Vim in this case, but not relevant to the development of the code).  The behaviour of the code was tested with almost every expression, so we gained a good understanding of each line of code.\nThere are ideas to take this further and show a visual representation of a message passing through a chain of clack tower, showing how the message would pass through the system at a human speed.  This woud assume a fixed time to show a clacks between each clack tower and a minimum level of speed by the human part of the clacks tower.\nNo REPL&apos;s were harmed in the making of this code, although one REPL was heavily used.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"introducing-clojure/clojure-strengths.html":{"url":"introducing-clojure/clojure-strengths.html","title":"Clojure strengths","body":"Strengths of Clojure\n\nfunctional programming language with a data-centric approach (mostly pure)\nvery small syntax making it quick to learn\ndynamic runtime &amp; language - a REPL and dynamic types makes development very quick\nfast-feedback approach for development, helping you quickly explore a problem domain\nImmutable values by default - data is copied rather than changed\na modern implementation of LISP\na highly extensible language via macros - no need to wait for language designers to add features\nan efficient way to manage state changes via persistent data structures &amp; software transactional memory\n\n Avoid state changes means simpler codeIn functional programming we avoid changing state as much as possible.
