These instructions typically modifies program state until the desired result is achieved.\nVariables typically represent memory addresses that are mutable (can be changed) by default.\n\nFunctional programming languages\nIn functional programming individual tasks are small and achieved by passing data to a function which returns a result.  This function typically does not change the state of the system or other functions.\nFunctions are composed together to form more complex tasks and satify larger business logic.  These composed functions pass the result of their evaluation to the next function, until all functions in the composition have been evaluated.\nThe entire functional program can be thought of as a single function defined in terms of smaller ones.\nProgram execution is an evaluation of expressions, with the nesting structure of function composition determining program flow.\nVariables are typically immutable and represent values (in the mathematical sence).\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"introducing-clojure/who-uses-clojure.html":{"url":"introducing-clojure/who-uses-clojure.html","title":"Powerful - many uses of Clojure","keywords":"","body":"Powerful - Many uses of Clojure\nThere are many companies using Clojure as either their main development language or for building specific applications and services.

Every single sale they make is managed by a system written in Clojure.\nIn just one day they had a record 133 Million people buying over $50 Million worth of products across 5,000 physical stores and the online store.\nFurther reading: Walmart runs Clojure at Scale\n\n\nNASA's Earth Science Data Information System (ESDIS) project is responsible for providing access to Earth Observation data and services to an ever-growing user community including â€” but not limited to â€” Earth scientists, educators, other government agencies, decision makers, and the general public. As data archives grow and more data becomes accessible online â€” cataloging, searching, and extracting relevant data from these archives becomes a critical part of Earth science research.\nCommon Metadata Repository (CMR) is an earth science metadata repository for NASA EOSDIS data. The CMR Search API provides access to this metadata.\n\n\n\nProcesses large volumes of data from financial services, insurance companies to drive their price comparison website.\nuSwitch is a major supporter of the London Clojurian Community having used Clojure since it's early 1.0 days. They run regular coding dojos at their offices for newcomers to the language, and sponsor various community events and conferences (such as EuroClojure, ClojureBridge, and the Clojure Exchange). They frequently commit to open-source Clojure libraries and have also participated in the annual Clojure Cup.\nThe revolution at uSwitch began in 2010 after the company was acquired by Forward Internet Group. uSwitch's .NET monolithic systems were strangled and subsequently replaced with a system of microservices, written in Clojure, Ruby, Go and more.\nAs with the changes to technology, the organisation also transformed from being functionally structured to product-oriented; decoupling the business to make it more resilient and easier to scale.\n\n\nHealthUnlocked created a social network centred around chronic health conditions. Their users share 4.5 pieces of health content every minute across this network. Using the Clojure tooling they created, this information is classified into 700 different categories within milliseconds.\nMachine learning is applied the experiences shared by their users to information they need to better manage their own health.\nNetworks are operated by charities and patient groups.  HealthUnlocked simply provides the tools for these organisations to manage their communities.\n\n\nFunding Circle is a high profile peer-to-peer lending marketplace that allows investors to lend money directly to small and medium-sized businesses. It is built on a big idea: \"To revolutionise the outdated banking system and secure a better deal for everyone\".\nThe business is now global lending huge amounts of money in various countries. In order to carry doing this successfully and to grow further, they need their technology to be streamlined and efficient.\nThey originally used Ruby throughout, but now they have over 40 Clojure developers spread across multiple countries including the US and the UK.\nClojure is used extensively for the performance sensitive back-end services, for example making decisions on who to give loans to, the accounting system, and the handling of interactions with the upstream banks.\n\n\nMetail provides online tools to the fashion industry.

One of the ClojureBridge projects is  Turtle, helping you understand the basics of using functions.\nQuil Examples\n\n\nThi.ng - an open source collection of 20+ computational design tools for Clojure & Clojurescript.\n\nExample applications\n\nGoya - a web application for creating pixel base images\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };

For example, 2 hours 25 minutes.How would you calculate the time elapsed in minutes?()\n\nReveal answer...\nAssuming its has been 2 hours and 20 minutes since you woke up, lets calculate the minutes:\n(+ (* 2 60) 25)\n\nWe add the result of multiplying 2 hours by 60 to get the number of minutes with the 25 minutes\nTo get the elapsed time in seconds, we can take the expression and wrap it with another expression that multiplies the result by 60.\n(* (+ (* 2 60) 25) 60)\n\n\n Convert from Minutes to Hours and MinutesIf the time elapsed is 428 minutes, how long is that in hours and minutes.First calculate how many hours there are in 428 minutes(quot x y) will give you the whole number part of x divided by y.Then calculate how many minutes are not part of a whole hour.(rem x y) will give you the remainder of x divided by y.()\n\nReveal answer...\nAssuming it has been 428 minutes since the workshop started, the number of hours could be calculated like this:\n(quot 428 60)\n;; => 7\n\nAnd the number of minutes calculated like this:\n(rem 428 60)\n;; => 8\n\n7 hours is 420 minutes, so there are 8 minutes remaining that do not fit into a whole hour.\nSo 428 minutes is the same as 7 hours and 8 minutes\n\n\n Representing Time and DatesMost programming languages have a way to specifically represent time and dates, typically based around a calendar.

This is called prefix notation. What you're used to seeing is called infix notation, as the arithmetic operator is in-between the two operands.\nLanguages such as JavaScript use infix notation, while Clojure only uses prefix notation.\nPrefix notation is useful for many reasons. Look at this example of an infix expression and the prefix equivalent:\nInfix:  1 + 2 * 3 / 4 + 5 - 6 * 7 / 8 + 9\n\nPrefix: (+ (- (+ (+ 1 (/ (* 2 3) 4)) 5) (/ (* 6 7) 8)) 9)\n\nThe benefits of prefix notation\nImagine both the above expressions are unclear.  However in the prefix version you do not have to ever think about the precedence of operators.\nBecause each expression has the operator before all the operands and the entire expression is wrapped in parentheses, all precedence is explicit.\nInfix:  1 + 2 / 3\nPrefix: (+ 1 (/ 2 3))\n\nLess repetitive\nAnother reason prefix notation can be nice is that it can make long\nexpressions less repetitive.\nWith prefix notation, if we plan to use the same operator on many\noperands, we do not have to repeat the operator between them.\nInfix:  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9\nPrefix: (+ 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9)\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"simple-values/strings.html":{"url":"simple-values/strings.html","title":"Strings","keywords":"","body":"Strings\nA String can contain any simple value such as numbers, letters or special characters.\nA string is surrounded with double quotation marks, \"\".\nStrings are used a lot for content (e.g. blogs), user interfaces (e.g. menus) as well any other simple data (e.g. names, email addresses).\nExample strings\n;; writing a string.

If we had chosen to use clojure.spec as well then we would have updated the project.clj file to use Clojure 1.9.x as a dependency instead.\nModeling the Celebrities\nThe simplest way to represent a celebrity name is in a string.  So we bound a name called celebrities to a string containing the first celebrity we could think of\n(def celebrities \"Brad Pitt\")\n\nAs we want to have two celebrities then we changed the data structure into a Clojure vector.  A vector is the most flexible data structure in Clojure.  So we redefined the name celebrities to be bound to a vector of strings containing the first celebrity couple we could think of.\n(def celebrities [\"Brad Pitt\" \"Angelina Jolie\"])\n\nSplitting names\nEach celebrity has a first and last name, so we need to split them into individual strings first.\n\nWe decided to exclude celebrities with just a single name.\n\nFrom a quick Google we found the clojure.string/split function that will split a string on a given pattern, that pattern being a regular expression (regex).\n(clojure.string/split \"Clojure is awesome!\" #\" \")\n\n;; => [\"Clojure\" \"is\" \"awesome!\"]\n\nThe regular expression pattern \" \" matches the space characters.  We could have also used #\"+s\" for the same results in this example, although it was felt that the space was clearer in intent.\nSo we wrote a function called name-split to take a first and last name as a string and return two separate strings, one for the first name and one for the last name.\n(defn name-split\n  \"Splits a celebrity name into their first & last names\"\n  [name]\n  (str/split name #\" \"))\n\nWe tested the name-split function in the repl\n(name-split \"Brad Pitt\")\n\n;; =>[\"Brad\" \"Pitt\"]\n\nWe could now successfully split the full name of a celebrity into their first and last names.\n\nA more advanced example of splitting up words would be to use re-seq with a regex patter, as in the HHGTTG book processing example in clojure-through-code.\n\nCreating sub-strings of names the long way\nAs the aim of our code is to create silly and weird names from celebrity names, we wont get the desired results with just the first and last names.  So we take those and split them.\nAt first we decided to split them in half, rounding down for odd length names.\nAs a Clojure String can be used like a collection of characters, we could simply take the first x number of characters.\n(take 2 \"Brad\")\n;; => (\\B \\r)\n\nThe value returned is a list of characters, so we would have to combine them back into a string.  Just using the str function on the result of the take function returned a lazy sequence.  To get a string we needed to apply or reduce with the str function\n;; (str (take 2 \"Brad\"))\n;; => \"clojure.lang.LazySeq@c31\"\n\n(apply str (take 2 \"Brad\"))   ;; => \"Br\"\n(reduce str (take 2 \"Brad\"))  ;; => \"Br\"\n\nTo do this for a name of any length we would need to count the string characters and divide by 2.\n(take (/ (count \"Brad\") 2) \"Brad\")\n;; => (\\B \\r)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count \"Brad\") 2) \"Brad\"))\n;; => \"Br\"\n\nThis code also works for names that have an odd number of characters.  When the odd number of characters is divided by two, a Clojure ratio type is used to hold the result rather than return a decimal value.  The take function calculated the value of the ratio type and rounds it to the nearest whole number.\nHere is a breakdown of how this code works with a name containing an odd number of characters.\n(count \"Bradley\")\n;; => 7\n\n(/ (count \"Bradley\") 2)\n;; => 7/2\n\n(take (/ (count \"Bradley\") 2) \"Bradley\")\n;; => (\\B \\r \\a \\d)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count \"Bradley\") 2) \"Bradley\"))\n;; => \"Brad\"\n\nCreating sub-strings the short way\nAfter reviewing this code it seemed a little complex for what we wanted, so a quick Google gave us the subs function.  The subs function takes a string and a starting point for the split, with an optional end point\n(subs \"Brad\" 0 2)\n;; => \"Br\"\n\n(subs \"Brad\" 2)\n;; => \"ad\"\n\n(subs \"Bradley\" 0 (/ (count \"Bradley\") 2))\n;; => \"Bra\"\n\nSo when we want the first part of the name we give the subs function a start point and an end point for the sub-division.  For the last part of a name we simply give the start point for the sub-division.\n\nHint If the take or subs function did not deal with odd numbers of characters, then instead of dividing by 2 we could have used the quot function.  The quote function divides the first argument by the second argument, returning the result as a whole number.\n\nCreating a subname function for the first name\nWe created a function that takes the name as a argument and returns the substring for the first half of the name\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (/ (count name) 2)]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\n;; calling the function with an odd length name\n(first-celeb-subname \"Bradley\")\n;; => \"Bra\"\n\nWe used the let function to create a local name (symbol) called end that points to the end position in the string, based on dividing the name by 2.  Then we call the subs function to get the substring from 0 to the value of end.\nCreating a more random sub-name function\nJust talking the half way point for our substring only gives one result.  If we add a random element to creating our substring then we should get many more variations in results.\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (+ 1 (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA slight refinement can be made by replacing + 1 with the inc function\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA subname function for the second celebrity\nWe wanted to combine two first names and two last names to make a new first & last name.  So we need a similar function to create the lastname subname\n(defn last-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [start (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name start)))\n\nThis function is almost identical to the first function, however only a start position is provided to subs function, creating a substring from the start position to the end of the name.\nPutting it all together\nFinally we call these functions from a main function named celeb-name-smash, which takes two celebrity names as string arguments and returns a string containing the smashed name.\n(defn celeb-name-smash\n  \"Smashes to celebrity names together\"\n  [celeb-one celeb-two]\n  (str (first-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-two)))\n       \" \"\n       (first-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-two)))))\n\n;; call the celeb-name-smash function with example data\n(name-smash-strings \"Brad Pitt\" \"Angelina Jolie\")\n;; => \"Brana Pitie\"\n;; => \"Brelina Pie\"\n;; => \"Brelina Piolie\"\n;; => \"Brlina Pi\"\n\nThe celeb-name-smash function has a lot of duplication, so should probably be refactored to make it more elegant.  However, we ran out of time at the dojo, so I will have a look at refactoring this function as homework.\nT\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"additional-projects/clacks-messages.html":{"url":"additional-projects/clacks-messages.html","title":"Clack Messages","keywords":"","body":"Clacks Messages - encoding and decoding text messages\n Covert clacks messages into multiple pages\nAt the March 2016 London Clojurians code dojo at uSwitch our group created a Clacks Interpreter in honor of Terry Pratchett, the author of the amazing Discworld series of books (and a few TV shows of those books too).\nIn the 33rd Discworld novel called Going Postal, messages are sent faster than a speeding horse via the Clacks system.  This composes of a series of towers that cross a continent and pass messages on via combinations of lights.  Each tower sees a grid of lights from a distant tower and sends the message on to the next tower.\n\nThe Clacks system was actually introduced in the 24th Discworld novel called \"The Fifth Elephant\", however its the \"Going Postal\" book where we learn the full history of the Clacks system.\n\nWe created a Clacks Interpreter that converts any English message into its corresponding clacks signal, based on the Clacks alphabet as defined by the board game of the same name.  The board game defines the alphabet as a 2 by 3 grid (although in the Discworld its actually 8 large squares).  Naturally, the interpreter also converts the Clacks signal back into an English message too.\n\nThe code is available on Github at: https://github.com/liamjtaylor/clacks-messenger and read on for a walk through of how we came up with the solution.\n\nThe Challenge\nWe wanted to be able to take any English language messages and transmit it across the clacks network, then\nRepresenting a Clack\nFor each clack, we read the pattern from the top of the first column to the bottom, then from the top of the second column to the bottom.  A light in a position represents a 1 value and no light represents a 0 value.  This gives us our 6 number pattern for each clack in the alphabet.\nDeciding the data structure\nThe initial data structure chosen was essentially just modelling each individual clack.  Since a clack is a 2x3 structure, the simplest way to represent a clacks is to have a vector that contains 2 vectors, each with three elements.\nSo a simple expression of the letter a in the clacks alphabet would be:\n[[0 1 0][0 0 1]]\n\nTherefore we could define a single letter of our alphabet as follows:\n(def a [[0 1 0][0 0 1]])\n\nBefore we define the complete alphabet using this data structure, lets test if we have the right data structure for our conversion process.\nTesting a simple conversion with our data structure\nLets try the simplest way to convert a character into a clack:\n(defn character->clack [character]\n  (if (= character \"a\")\n    a\n    (str \"Sorry, character is not yet in the alphabet, please create a pull request\")))\n\nCalling the function converts a string into the corresponding clack\n(character->clack \"a\")\n\nAlthough the code is simple for 1 character, it does highlight the problem of converting the whole alphabet.  We would need either a deeply nested set of if statements or a very long case statement, neither of which seems to be a particularly functional approach or idiomatic Clojure.\nEven if we did use a case statement, how would we convert a clack back into a character?\nSo perhaps we need to change the data structure, one that provides an easy way to map to values together.\nAlso, there seems no value in mapping values to a 2x3 grid as long as we consistently express a clack.\nDefining the alphabet with a map\nA map data structure in Clojure is a hash map (a key & value paring) for example I could define myself as a map\n{:name \"john\" :age \"21\" :twitter \"jr0cket\"}\n\nIts very common to use Clojure keywords for the keys, to make it easy to look up a particular value by referring to the keyword.\nSo the new design for our clacks data structure is as follows\n{:a [0 1 0 0 0 1]}\n\nTo help with testing this new data structure design, we crated enough letters of the clacks alphabet to make some simple words, i.e bat\n(def alphabet {:a [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n               :b [0 0 1 0 1 0]\n               :t [1 0 0 1 1 1]})\n\nTesting the map design\nWe can use the keyword to lookup the value of its clack code\n(alphabet :a)\n\n;; => [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n\nThen we created a simple function to convert a string to a sequence of clacks\n(defn character->clack [letter]\n  (if (= letter \"a\")\n    (alphabet :a)\n    (str \"Sorry, character is not yet in the alphabet, please create a pull request\")))\n\n\nThe -> character is part of the function name.  This is a Clojure naming convention used when the function you are defining converts from one type to another.\n\nAnd call the function as follows\n(character->clack \"a\")\n\n;; => [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n\nConverting a word\nNow we want to convert a whole word to a clacks sequence.  It seemed the easiest way to convert a whole word was to convert each letter at a time using the map to look up each clack code, returning all the clacks codes in a sequence.\nSo we redefined the string->clacks function to take in a whole word.\nWe used the map function to apply a conversion function over each element in the word (each element of the string).  This conversion function called clacksify.\n(defn clacksify [letter]\n  (let [character (str letter)]\n  (alphabet (keyword character))))\n\n(defn string->clacks [word]\n  (map clacksify word))\n\nNow we could convert any word that used the letters of our limited alphabet.  We chose bat as a simple word.\n(string->clacks \"bat\")\n\n\nAs we are passing a string and not a keyword to the clacksify function, then we first convert the string to a keyword using the keyword function.\n\nConverting the clack to a string\nIs there a simple way to look up a key given a value that is unique in the map?\nAll Clack codes are unique in the map, but there did not seem to be a simple expression to find the key when given a value.\nWe could have created a second mapping, however having two maps seemed redundant and a potential cause for silly bugs.\nThe answer was simple once we found it.  As the clack codes are unique, they could be used as keys for the letter values, we just needed to swap the map around.  Swapping a map's keys and values was done by writing a reverse-map function.\n(defn reverse-map\n  \"Reverse the keys and value pairs in a map.\n  Allows the map to be used to convert from a clack to a letter without defining a second map\"\n  [m]\n  (into {} (map (fn [[a b]] [b a]) m)))\n\nSo we defined the function declacksify which takes a clack code and returns its corresponding character.  The clack code returns the corresponding keyword rather than a character, so we use the name function to convert the keyword into a character name.\n(defn declacksify [clack]\n  (name ((reverse-map alphabet) clack)))\n\n(defn clacks->string [clacks]\n  (map declacksify clacks))\n\nSo calling these functions with a clacks\n(declacksify  [1 0 0 1 1 1])\n;; => \"t\"\n\n(clacks->string [[0 0 1 0 1 0] [0 1 0 0 0 1] [1 0 0 1 1 1]])\n;; => (\"b\" \"a\" \"t\")\n\n\nIts probably at this point we should have realised that we didn't need to use keywords to represent the characters of the alphabet.  In fact, using keywords made a little more work for us.\n\nTyding up the output\nOur clacks->string function returns the right result, but not quite in the format we want.  Rather than a single string, we get the individual characters.\nUsing the reduce function we can apply the str function over the resulting characters to give a single string.  So our function becomes\n(defn clacks->string [clacks]\n(map str (map declacksify clacks)))\n\nWorking with another language\nThanks to a flexible design with no side effects or side causes then its really easy to replace the English language alphabet with another language that can be encoded into Clack codes.  So languages based on the greek, latin or cyrillic alphabet could be send if a suitable alphabet with clack codes is supplied.\nSummary\nWe were quite happy with the code produced in this dojo.  The code is pretty readable we believe and we have taken a fairly simple approach to the design.  In hindsight we could have made the code even easier if we had tested out the map data structure a little more and used a string character for each letter in the alphabet.\nWorking in an editor attached to a REPL worked well (Vim in this case, but not relevant to the development of the code).  The behaviour of the code was tested with almost every expression, so we gained a good understanding of each line of code.\nThere are ideas to take this further and show a visual representation of a message passing through a chain of clack tower, showing how the message would pass through the system at a human speed.  This would assume a fixed time to show a clacks between each clack tower and a minimum level of speed by the human part of the clacks tower.\nNo REPL's were harmed in the making of this code, although one REPL was heavily used.\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"additional-projects/clojurebridge-website/":{"url":"additional-projects/clojurebridge-website/","title":"ClojureBridge website","keywords":"","body":"Live ClojureScript websites\n This section is new, so feedback is appreciated\nThis tutorial guides you through the creation of a relatively simple, responsive website that is deployed live on the Internet.\nYou will discover how to use the following tools:\n\nClojureScript - writing functions for sections of content\nReagent - add basic state management to the website\nBulma - a CSS only framework for responsive design\nFigwheel-main - an interactive development environment for ClojureScript\nGitHub Pages - a free service for deploying your website on the Internet\n\nExample ClojureScript websites\n\nClojureBridge London, a landing page for the event using Bulma CSS, global navigation and responsive design.\nClojureBridge London source code\nPracticalli, a landing page using Bulma CSS (similar to the above)\nClojure Study Group project a ClojureScript and bootstrap website\n\nLooking for something more?\npesterhazy/cljs-spa-example is a more involved example of a Single Page Application in ClojureScript.

If a function does not change state it always returns the same result when given the same input (arguments).  These are referred to as Pure Functions.

Why is your code doing what it is doing.  Why did you make the choice to write the code that way.\nIn Clojure a comment is started by the character: ;\nClojure ignores any line that starts with ;, so comments are purely for the developers working with the code.\nWhen we write code, we try to make it as clear as possible.  This helps others understand what was written quickly.  Sometimes we can do this without comments, sometimes comments are very useful.\n HintDevelopers often come back to code they wrote themselves a while ago and realise they have forgotten why they wrote the code in a particular way.  Good comments give you contexts to understand why the code was written.\n;; simple examples of functions to intrigue you for the next few pages\n(str \"Hello\" \" \" \"World!\")   ; a well-known hello world example\n(+ 3 4)                      ; why is this not written as 3 + 4?\n\nComments style\nIn Clojure, comments can be started with a semicolon. Everything after a semicolon until the end of that line is a comment that gets ignored by the computer.\nThe Clojure style guide recommends a single semicolon for a comment part way through a line, eg, after the code.  Two comments should be used to comment at the start of a row.\n\nReference: Comment\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"contribute.html":{"url":"contribute.html","title":"Contribute","keywords":"","body":"Contributing to ClojureBridge Workshop\nThank you for considering contributing to the content of this workshop.\nAny of the following aspects are valuable contributions\n\nCode examples\nExplanations of Clojure & Functional Programming concepts\nCode challenges (exercises for students)\n\nFeedback on: \n\nhow well any concepts are explained\nhow simple the code examples are to follow\nif code challenges are clear, to easy or to challenging\n\nPlease ask about contributing at the #clojurebridge-london channel on the Clojurians Slack community.  \n\nUse the Clojurians.net slackbot for an invite if you do not have a login account for the Clojurians Slack community.\n\nHow to Contribute\nYou can either add or edit content directly on the ClojureBridge Workshop Github repository or fork that repository and make changes with your favourite editor and submit a pull request.\nAll content is in markdown files, ending with a file extension of .md.\nAll content is in English with UK spelling, except in some code snippets that use Americanised words (eg. color).\nCreating a local environment\nThe Workshop uses Gitbook to create the website content (html, css, javascript) from the markdown pages.  \nYou can run your own Gitbook server to see what your changes look like before making a commit.\nInstall Node.js\nGitbook requires Node.js and recommends version 6.11.x or greater\nThe Node.js website  has installation instructions.  To test you have nodejs working, run the command node -v\nInstall Gitbook\nInstall Gitbook npm package globally (where-ever nodejs itself is installed) using the command\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\n\n\nIf the above fails because nodejs is installed in a protected area of your filespace, you will need to install gitbook as administrator using the following command instead sudo npm install gitbook-cli -g\n\nClone the Workshop content\nUse git to download a local copy of the workshop content to your local machine.  For example:\ngit clone https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/workshop-content-gitbook.git\n\nInstall Gitbook plugins\nOnce downloaded, change into the workshop-content-gitbook directory and run the following command to install the supporting plugins for Gitbook\ngitbook install\n\nDo not run gitbook install as administrator, only your normal user account.  These plugins are installed locally in a folder called node-modules inside the workshop-content-gitbook directory.\n Do not run gitbook initPlease do not run gitbook init inside the workshop-content-gitbook directory or it will updated the navigation and add a second readme.md file.\nRunning Gitbook locally\nGitbook will run a local webserver on port :4000 using the command:\ngitbook serve\n\nView the website using http://localhost:4000\nMaking changes\nEdit or create new files and once you save changes the website will automatically update.\nChanging the Navigation\nThe navigation is defined in the file SUMMARY.md.\nEach line in this file creates a link in the left hand side navigation of the Gitbook website.  The syntax is [Link name](/path/to/file.md).\nNested pages of the navigation are defined by inserting 4 space characters at the start of a line.  There can be several levels of nesting.\nA style guide for the navigation is to create a directory and index.md file for each section and contain all the markdown files under that section in that directory.\nContributing changes\nPlease create a pull request on the ClojureBridge Workshop Github repository.\nThank you.\n@jr0cket\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"fancy-keyboard-keys.html":{"url":"fancy-keyboard-keys.html","title":"Fancy Keyboard Keys","keywords":"","body":"Fancy keyboard things\n\nUsing the Clojure REPL\n(Option) You may create a new file and write code in the file.
