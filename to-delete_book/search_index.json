Some of the other languages you might have heard of (or will hear of!) are C, JavaScript, Python, and Java.\nSo why are we teaching Clojure?\nWe&apos;re using Clojure because of three qualities it has which make it an ideal first language to learn, or a great language to learn in addition to others you might already know.\nClojure is simple\nClojure is simple. That&apos;s not to say it&apos;s not powerful; it is. The number of concepts you have to know to program in Clojure is very small, however, and easy to grasp.\nClojure grows with you as you learn it, and you can be very productive with a small subset of the language.\nSimple is also more easier to manage in the long term.\nIf you imagine building roads, some have to be twisty and complex.  Each time someone drives down these roads it is harder than driving on a straight road.\n\n\nClojure is all-purpose\nClojure is all-purpose. Some languages have a specific focus.\nJavaScript, for example, was traditionally used only in web pages (although that&apos;s changed somewhat).\nObjective-C and Swift are used mainly for iPhone and other Apple apps.\nWe&apos;re going to make a drawing application today, but you can use Clojure for any sort of application easily.\n\n\nClojure is Fun\nClojure is fun.\nThat&apos;s a matter of opinion, of course, but we think it holds true. I hope that during this course you experience the joy of seeing a Clojure program come together and do something powerful and surprising.\n\nKlipse for Kids\n\n\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"introducing-clojure/who-uses-clojure.html":{"url":"introducing-clojure/who-uses-clojure.html","title":"Who uses Clojure","body":"Who Uses Clojure\nThere are many companies using Clojure as either their main development language or for building specific applications and services.  Here are just a few examples from the UK.  Further examples are discussed in the Clojure in... series by JUXT\n\n\nSignal Media is a machine learning company extracting knowledge from 3 million documents a day from newspapers, magazines, broadcasts, and online publications.\nEach piece of content needs to be understood: what it is about? Who is being mentioned? Is it &#39;apple&#39; the fruit or Apple the company? Is it the Trump company being mentioned or the Donald Trump presidency? To face up against these challenges\nSignal uses natural language processing and machine learning to understand the context of information, eg. if apple is mentioned, is it the fruit or the company?.\nSignal perform spam detection (filtering), language detection and translation (40 different languages from 90 different countries) anomaly detection and sentiment analysis.  The results made searchable so you can ask questions like: Show me all the tweets and blog posts about Clojure.\n\n\nProcesses large volumes of data from financial services, insurance companies to drive their price comparison website.\nuSwitch is a major supporter of the London Clojurian Community having used Clojure since it&#39;s early 1.0 days. They run regular coding dojos at their offices for newcomers to the language, and sponsor various community events and conferences (such as EuroClojure, ClojureBridge, and the Clojure Exchange). They frequently commit to open-source Clojure libraries and have also participated in the annual Clojure Cup.\nThe revolution at uSwitch began in 2010 after the company was acquired by Forward Internet Group. uSwitch&#39;s .NET monolithic systems were strangled and subsequently replaced with a system of microservices, written in Clojure, Ruby, Go and more.\nAs with the changes to technology, the organisation also transformed from being functionally structured to product-oriented; decoupling the business to make it more resilient and easier to scale.\n\n\nHealthUnlocked created a social network centred around chronic health conditions. Their users share 4.5 pieces of health content every minute across this network. Using the Clojure tooling they created, this information is classified into 700 different categories within milliseconds.\nMachine learning is applied the experiences shared by their users to information they need to better manage their own health.\nNetworks are operated by charities and patient groups.  HealthUnlocked simply provides the tools for these organisations to manage their communities.\n\n\nMetail provides online tools to the fashion industry.  With just 5 measurements customers can see what clothes will look like using accurate 3D avatars of their body shape.\nMachine learning and data science services make recommendations and give fashion advice, whilst being able to feed data back to the clothes producers as to improve cuts and sizing. Their software is delivered to online retailers across the globe, including India, Korea, Thailand and Europe.\nMetail uses Clojure for their RESTful API services and ClojureScript on the front-end. They maintain a Metail tech blog and host a variety of meet-ups at their offices such as Data Insights Cambridge, Cambridge AWS User Group, and Cambridge NonDysFunctional Programmers. Metail also sponsored this year&#39;s /dev/summer.\n\n\nCiti Group is the largest financial company in the world employing 220 million people across the world.

This does of course mean that there is more content than anyone can cover in once day.\n InfoYou should have a Clojure environment set up from our event on Friday evening, if you missed this then please get in touch with an organiser straight away.\nOutline for the morning\nThe morning covers the language syntax of Clojure, so you can speak Clojure to your computer, along with some of the core concepts of thinking functionally.\n\nSimple values (numbers, characters, strings)\nCalling functions in Clojure\nCollections of Values\nFunctions as arguments\nControl flow (list comprehension, for/when)\nIteration (loop/recur, fn/recur, filter, predicates)\nmap &amp; reduce\nnaming\ndefining functions\n\nOutline for the afternoon\nThere are many projects to choose from which you can work together in pairs or as a group.\nSome projects have detailed steps you can simply follow along, whist others encourage you to explore your own solutions.  As there are many ways to do things, there is no right or wrong answers, just opportunities to think and learn.\n  Projects currently being sourced from the community and organised\nGuided projects\n\nMap Reduce sandwich (incorporate into main course material)\nCelebrity Name Smash - string manipulation: subs count, take, str, lazy sequence, apply, reduce\nClacks messages - simple encoding &amp; decoding of messages, thinking about data structures: maps (key value pairs), get, map reduce  (extension of the map reduce sandwich)\n\nOther possible exercises (may need some work)\n\nPaying the restaurant bill\nMonthly budget calculator (food, parties, bills, etc)\nClojureBridge London event management - register coaches and attendees and try match them up based on skills &amp; experiences (webapp using ring / compojure - alternative to practicalli, webapps ?)\nCurrency converter: compare the current value of currencies (given one currency, show its value in one or more other currencies); track currency changes; compare currency changes over time.

This is called prefix notation. What you&#39;re used to seeing is called infix notation, as the arithmetic operator is in-between the two operands.\nLanguages such as JavaScript use infix notation, while Clojure only uses prefix notation.\nPrefix notation is useful for many reasons. Look at this example of an infix expression and the prefix equivalent:\nInfix:  1 + 2 * 3 / 4 + 5 - 6 * 7 / 8 + 9\n\nPrefix: (+ (- (+ (+ 1 (/ (* 2 3) 4)) 5) (/ (* 6 7) 8)) 9)\n\nThe benefits of prefix notation\nImagine both the above expressions are unclear.

We could have also used #&quot;+s&quot; for the same results in this example, although it was felt that the space was clearer in intent.\nSo we wrote a function called name-split to take a first and last name as a string and return two seperate strings, one for the first name and one for the last name.\n(defn name-split\n  &quot;Splits a celebrity name into their first &amp; last names&quot;\n  [name]\n  (str/split name #&quot; &quot;))\n\nWe tested the name-split function in the repl\n(name-split &quot;Brad Pitt&quot;)\n\n;; =&gt;[&quot;Brad&quot; &quot;Pitt&quot;]\n\nWe could now succesfully split the full name of a celebrity into their first and last names.\n\nA more advanced example of splitting up words would be to use re-seq with a regex patter, as in the HHGTTG book processing example in clojure-through-code.\n\nCreating sub-strings of names the long way\nAs the aim of our code is to create silly and weird names from celebrity names, we wont get the desired results with just the first and last names.  So we take those and split them.\nAt first we decided to split them in half, rounding down for odd lenght names.\nAs a Clojure String can be used like a collection of characters, we could simply take the first x number of characters.\n(take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r)\n\nThe value returned is a list of characters, so we would have to combine them back into a string.  Just using the str function on the result of the take function returned a lazy sequence.  To get a string we needed to apply or reduce with the str function\n;; (str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;clojure.lang.LazySeq@c31&quot;\n\n(apply str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))   ;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n(reduce str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))  ;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\nTo do this for a name of any length we would need to count the string characters and divide by 2.\n(take (/ (count &quot;Brad&quot;) 2) &quot;Brad&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count &quot;Brad&quot;) 2) &quot;Brad&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\nThis code also works for names that have an odd number of characters.  When the odd number of characters is divided by two, a Clojure ratio type is used to hold the result rather than return a decimal value.  The take function calculated the value of the ratio type and rounds it to the nearest whole number.\nHere is a breakdown of how this code works with a name containing an odd number of characters.\n(count &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; 7\n\n(/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2)\n;; =&gt; 7/2\n\n(take (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2) &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r \\a \\d)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2) &quot;Bradley&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brad&quot;\n\nCreating sub-strings the short way\nAfter reviewing this code it seemed a little complex for what we wanted, so a quick Google gave us the subs function.  The subs function takes a string and a starting point for the split, with an optional end point\n(subs &quot;Brad&quot; 0 2)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\n(subs &quot;Brad&quot; 2)\n;; =&gt; &quot;ad&quot;\n\n(subs &quot;Bradley&quot; 0 (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Bra&quot;\n\nSo when we want the first part of the name we give the subs function a start point and an end point for the sub-division.  For the last part of a name we simply give the start point for the sub-division.\n\nHint If the take or subs function did not deal with odd numbers of characters, then instead of dividing by 2 we could have used the quot function.  The quote function divides the first argument by the second argument, returning the result as a whole number.\n\nCreating a subname function for the first name\nWe created a function that takes the name as a argument and returns the substring for the first half of the name\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (/ (count name) 2)]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\n;; calling the function with an odd lenght name\n(first-celeb-subname &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Bra&quot;\n\nWe used the let function to create a local name (symbol) called end that points to the end position in the string, based on dividing the name by 2.  Then we call the subs fuction to get the substring from 0 to the value of end.\nCreating a more random sub-name function\nJust talking the half way point for our substring only gives one result.  If we add a random element to creating our substring then we should get many more variations in results.\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (+ 1 (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA slight refinement can be made by replacing + 1 with the inc function\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA subname function for the second celebrity\nWe wanted to combine two first names and two last names to make a new first &amp; last name.  So we need a similar function to create the lastname subname\n(defn last-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [start (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name start)))\n\nThis function is almost identical to the first function, however only a start position is provided to subs function, creating a substring from the start position to the end of the name.\nPutting it all together\nFinally we call these functions from a main function named celeb-name-smash, which takes two celebrity names as string arguments and returns a string containing the smashed name.\n(defn celeb-name-smash\n  &quot;Smashes to celebrity names together&quot;\n  [celeb-one celeb-two]\n  (str (first-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-two)))\n       &quot; &quot;\n       (first-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-two)))))\n\n;; call the celeb-name-smash function with example data\n(name-smash-strings &quot;Brad Pitt&quot; &quot;Angelina Jolie&quot;)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brana Pitie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brelina Pie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brelina Piolie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brlina Pi&quot;\n\nThe celeb-name-smash function has a lot of duplication, so should probably be refactored to make it more elegant.  However, we ran out of time at the dojo, so I will have a look at refactoring this function as homework.\nT\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"functions/functions-as-arguments.html":{"url":"functions/functions-as-arguments.html","title":"Higher Order Functions","body":"Functions as arguments to functions\nSome of the most powerful functions you can use with collection can take other functions as arguments.\nThis is one of the most magical things about Clojure and many other programming languages.\nIt&#39;s a complicated idea that may not make sense at first.\nLet&#39;s look at an example to learn more about it.\n\nReference: Higher-order Function\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"functions/map-function.html":{"url":"functions/map-function.html","title":"map function","body":"map function\nmap is a function that takes another function as an argument, along with a collection.\nmap calls the function provided to it on each member of the collection, then returns a new collection with the results of those function calls.\nThis may feel a strange concept, but it is at the core of Clojure and functional programming.\n(map even?

These are also functions for sequences.\ndoseq\nThe doseq(for do a sequence) is one of well-used functions for sequences, and works quite similar to map function. The\nfunction repeatedly evaluates given body form with each element in the given sequence.\nThe doseq function takes bindings as arguments. The arguments might be an odd-looking vector: [name sequence]. When each element of a sequence is iterated over, the element is assigned to the name one by one.\n;; doseq example\n(doseq [n (turtle-names)] (forward n 40))\n\nEXERCISE 1\n\nTurtles Walk (more function study) \nsection 5 and later\n\n\nSnowflakes (animation)\nstep 4 and later\n\n\nTwinkle Twinkle Little Star (making sounds)\nchord function and later\n\n\n\ndotimes\nThe dotimes(for do number of times) is another well-used\nfunction for sequences. Like doseq, the function repeatedly\nevaluates given body form. The difference is the binding in the\nargument. The dotimes takes: [name max-integer].\nThe dotimes function is the closest to so-called for-loop in other\nprogramming languages.

                   :level 5, :job-title &quot;engineer&quot;} {}))\n;;\n;; Ran 1 tests containing 2 assertions.\n;; 1 failures, 0 errors.\n==== Discussion\nThe preceding example only scratches the surface of what +clojure.test+\nprovides for unit testing. Let&#39;s take a bottom-up look at its other\nfeatures.\nFirst, you can improve reporting when an assertion fails by providing\na second argument that explains what the assertion is intended to\ntest. When you run this test, you will see an extended description of\nhow the code was expected to behave:\n[source,clojure]\n(is (= (capitalize-entries {:office &quot;space&quot;} :office) {})\n    &quot;The employee&#39;s office entry should be capitalized.&quot;)\n;; -&gt; false\n;;  out\n;; FAIL in clojure.lang.PersistentList$EmptyList@1 (NO_SOURCE_FILE:1)\n;; The employee&#39;s office entry should be capitalized.\n;; expected: (= (capitalize-entries {:office &quot;space&quot;} :office) {})\n;;   actual: (not (= {:office &quot;Space&quot;} {}))\nFor testing a function like +capitalize-entries+ thoroughly, several\nuse cases need to be considered. To more concisely test numerous\nsimilar cases, use the +clojure.test/are+ macro:\n[source,clojure]\n(deftest test-capitalize-entries\n  (let [employee {:last-name &quot;smith&quot;\n                  :job-title &quot;engineer&quot;\n                  :level 5\n                  :office &quot;seattle&quot;}]\n    (are [ks m] (= (apply capitalize-entries employee ks) m)\n         [] employee\n         [:not-a-key] employee\n         [:job-title] {:job-title &quot;Engineer&quot;\n                       :last-name &quot;smith&quot;\n                       :level 5\n                       :office &quot;seattle&quot;}\n         [:last-name :office] {:last-name &quot;Smith&quot;\n                               :office &quot;Seattle&quot;\n                               :level 5\n                           :job-title &quot;engineer&quot;})))\n\nThe first two parameters to +are+ set up a testing pattern: given a\nsequence of keys +ks+ and a map +m+, call +capitalize-entries+ for\nthose keys on the original +employee+ map and assert that the return\nvalue equals +m+.\nWriting out multiple use cases in a declarative\nsyntax makes it easier to catch errors and untreated edge cases, such\nas the +NullPointerException+ that will be thrown for the\n[:not-a-key] employee assertion pair in the preceding test.(((truthiness)))\nUnlike testing frameworks for other popular dynamic languages,\nClojure&#39;s built-in assertions are minimal and simple. The +is+ and\n+are+ macros check test expressions for &quot;truthiness&quot; (i.e., that those\nexpressions return neither +false+ nor +nil+, in which case they pass).\nBeyond this, you can also check for +thrown?+ or +thrown-with-msg?+ to\ntest that a certain +java.lang.Throwable+ (error or exception) is\nexpected:\n[source,clojure]\n(is (thrown? IndexOutOfBoundsException (nth [] 1)))\nAbove the level of individual assertions, +clojure.test+ also provides\nfacilities for calling functions before or after tests run. In the\n+test-capitalize-entries+ test, we defined an ad hoc +employee+ map for\ntesting, but you could also read in external data to be shared across\nmultiple tests by registering a data-loading function as a &quot;fixture.&quot;\nThe +clojure.test/use-fixtures+ multimethod allows registering Clojure\nfunctions to be called either before or after each test, or before or\nafter an entire namespace&#39;s test suite. The following example defines\nand registers three fixture functions:\n[source,clojure]\n(require &#39;[clojure.edn :as edn])\n(def test-data (atom nil))\n;; Assuming you have a test-data.edn file...\n(defn load-data &quot;Read a Clojure map from test data in a file.&quot;\n  [test-fn]\n  (reset! test-data (edn/read-string (slurp &quot;test-data.edn&quot;)))\n  (test-fn))\n(defn add-test-id &quot;Add a unique id to the data before each test.&quot;\n  [test-fn]\n  (swap! test-data assoc :id (java.util.UUID/randomUUID))\n  (test-fn))\n(defn inc-count &quot;Increment a counter in the data after each test runs.&quot;\n  [test-fn]\n  (test-fn)\n  (swap! test-data update-in [:count] (fnil inc 0)))\n(use-fixtures :once load-data)\n(use-fixtures :each add-test-id inc-count)\n;; Tests...\nYou can think about fixture functions as forming a pipeline through\nwhich each test is passed as a parameter, which we called +test-fn+ in\nthe preceding example. Take +inc-count+, for example. It is the job of this\nfixture to invoke the +test-fn+ function, continuing the pipeline, and\nafterward, to increment a count (i.e., &quot;do some work&quot;). Each fixture\ndecides whether to invoke +test-fn+ before or after its own work\n(compare the +add-test-id+ function with the +inc-count+ function),\nwhile the +clojure.test/use-fixtures+ multimethod controls whether\neach registered fixture function is run only once for all tests in a\nnamespace or once for each test.\nFinally, with a firm understanding of how to develop individual\nClojure test suites, it is important to consider how you organize and\nrun those suites as part of your project&#39;s build. Although Clojure\nallows defining tests for functions anywhere in your code base, you\nshould keep your testing code in a separate directory that is only\nadded to the JVM classpath when needed (e.g., during development and\ntesting). It is conventional to name your test namespaces after the\nnamespaces they test, so that a file located at\n/src/com/example/core.clj with namespace\n+com.example.core+ has a corresponding test file at\n/test/com/example/core_test.clj with namespace\n+com.example.core-test+. To control the location of your source and\ntest directories and their inclusion on the JVM classpath, you should\nuse a build tool like link:http://leiningen.org/[Leiningen] or\nlink:http://maven.apache.org/[Maven] to organize your project.\nIn Leiningen, the default directory for your tests is a top-level\n/test folder, and you can run your project&#39;s tests with\n+lein test+ at the command line. Without any additional arguments, the\n+lein test+ command will execute all of the tests in a project:\n[source,shell-session]\n$ lein test\nlein test com.example.core-test\nlein test com.example.util-test\nRan 10 tests containing 20 assertions.\n0 failures, 0 errors.\nTo limit the scope of tests Leiningen runs, use the +:only+ option,\nfollowed by a fully qualified namespace or function name:\n[source,shell-session]\nTo run an entire namespace\n$ lein test :only com.example.core-test\nlein test com.example.core-test\nRan 5 tests containing 10 assertions.\n0 failures, 0 errors.\nTo run one specific test\n$ lein test :only com.example.core-test/test-capitalize-entries\nlein test com.example.core-test\nRan 1 tests containing 2 assertions.\n0 failures, 0 errors.\n==== See Also\n\nThe +clojure.test+ http://bit.ly/clj-test-api[API documentation] contains full information on the unit-testing framework.\nIf you are instead using Maven, use   https://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin[+clojure-maven-plugin+]\nto run Clojure tests.

If we had chosen to use clojure.spec as well then we would have updated the project.clj file to use Clojure 1.9.x as a dependency instead.\nModeling the Celebrities\nThe simplest way to represent a celebrity name is in a string.  So we bount a name called celebrities to a string containing the first celebrity we could think of\n(def celbrties &quot;Brad Pitt&quot;)\n\nAs we want to have two celebrties then we changed the data structure into a Clojure vector.  A vector is the most flexible data structure in Clojure.  So we redefined the name celebrities to be bound to a vector of strings containing the first celebrity couple we could think of.\n(def celebrities [&quot;Brad Pitt&quot; &quot;Angelina Jolie&quot;])\n\nSplitting names\nEach celebrity has a first and last name, so we need to split them into individual strings first.\n\nWe decided to exclude celebrities with just a single name.\n\nFrom a quick Google we found the clojure.string/split function that will split a string on a given pattern, that pattern being a regular expression (regex).\n(clojure.string/split &quot;Clojure is awesome!&quot; #&quot; &quot;)\n\n;; =&gt; [&quot;Clojure&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;awesome!&quot;]\n\nThe regular expression pattern &quot; &quot; matches the space characters.  We could have also used #&quot;+s&quot; for the same results in this example, although it was felt that the space was clearer in intent.\nSo we wrote a function called name-split to take a first and last name as a string and return two seperate strings, one for the first name and one for the last name.\n(defn name-split\n  &quot;Splits a celebrity name into their first &amp; last names&quot;\n  [name]\n  (str/split name #&quot; &quot;))\n\nWe tested the name-split function in the repl\n(name-split &quot;Brad Pitt&quot;)\n\n;; =&gt;[&quot;Brad&quot; &quot;Pitt&quot;]\n\nWe could now succesfully split the full name of a celebrity into their first and last names.\n\nA more advanced example of splitting up words would be to use re-seq with a regex patter, as in the HHGTTG book processing example in clojure-through-code.\n\nCreating sub-strings of names the long way\nAs the aim of our code is to create silly and weird names from celebrity names, we wont get the desired results with just the first and last names.  So we take those and split them.\nAt first we decided to split them in half, rounding down for odd lenght names.\nAs a Clojure String can be used like a collection of characters, we could simply take the first x number of characters.\n(take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r)\n\nThe value returned is a list of characters, so we would have to combine them back into a string.  Just using the str function on the result of the take function returned a lazy sequence.  To get a string we needed to apply or reduce with the str function\n;; (str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;clojure.lang.LazySeq@c31&quot;\n\n(apply str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))   ;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n(reduce str (take 2 &quot;Brad&quot;))  ;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\nTo do this for a name of any length we would need to count the string characters and divide by 2.\n(take (/ (count &quot;Brad&quot;) 2) &quot;Brad&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count &quot;Brad&quot;) 2) &quot;Brad&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\nThis code also works for names that have an odd number of characters.  When the odd number of characters is divided by two, a Clojure ratio type is used to hold the result rather than return a decimal value.  The take function calculated the value of the ratio type and rounds it to the nearest whole number.\nHere is a breakdown of how this code works with a name containing an odd number of characters.\n(count &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; 7\n\n(/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2)\n;; =&gt; 7/2\n\n(take (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2) &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; (\\B \\r \\a \\d)\n\n(apply str (take (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2) &quot;Bradley&quot;))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brad&quot;\n\nCreating sub-strings the short way\nAfter reviewing this code it seemed a little complex for what we wanted, so a quick Google gave us the subs function.  The subs function takes a string and a starting point for the split, with an optional end point\n(subs &quot;Brad&quot; 0 2)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Br&quot;\n\n(subs &quot;Brad&quot; 2)\n;; =&gt; &quot;ad&quot;\n\n(subs &quot;Bradley&quot; 0 (/ (count &quot;Bradley&quot;) 2))\n;; =&gt; &quot;Bra&quot;\n\nSo when we want the first part of the name we give the subs function a start point and an end point for the sub-division.  For the last part of a name we simply give the start point for the sub-division.\n\nHint If the take or subs function did not deal with odd numbers of characters, then instead of dividing by 2 we could have used the quot function.  The quote function divides the first argument by the second argument, returning the result as a whole number.\n\nCreating a subname function for the first name\nWe created a function that takes the name as a argument and returns the substring for the first half of the name\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (/ (count name) 2)]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\n;; calling the function with an odd lenght name\n(first-celeb-subname &quot;Bradley&quot;)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Bra&quot;\n\nWe used the let function to create a local name (symbol) called end that points to the end position in the string, based on dividing the name by 2.  Then we call the subs fuction to get the substring from 0 to the value of end.\nCreating a more random sub-name function\nJust talking the half way point for our substring only gives one result.  If we add a random element to creating our substring then we should get many more variations in results.\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (+ 1 (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA slight refinement can be made by replacing + 1 with the inc function\n(defn first-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [end (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name 0 end)))\n\nA subname function for the second celebrity\nWe wanted to combine two first names and two last names to make a new first &amp; last name.  So we need a similar function to create the lastname subname\n(defn last-celeb-subname [name]\n  (let [start (inc (rand-int (count name)))]\n    (subs name start)))\n\nThis function is almost identical to the first function, however only a start position is provided to subs function, creating a substring from the start position to the end of the name.\nPutting it all together\nFinally we call these functions from a main function named celeb-name-smash, which takes two celebrity names as string arguments and returns a string containing the smashed name.\n(defn celeb-name-smash\n  &quot;Smashes to celebrity names together&quot;\n  [celeb-one celeb-two]\n  (str (first-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (first (name-split celeb-two)))\n       &quot; &quot;\n       (first-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-one)))\n       (second-celeb-subname (last (name-split celeb-two)))))\n\n;; call the celeb-name-smash function with example data\n(name-smash-strings &quot;Brad Pitt&quot; &quot;Angelina Jolie&quot;)\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brana Pitie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brelina Pie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brelina Piolie&quot;\n;; =&gt; &quot;Brlina Pi&quot;\n\nThe celeb-name-smash function has a lot of duplication, so should probably be refactored to make it more elegant.  However, we ran out of time at the dojo, so I will have a look at refactoring this function as homework.\nT\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "},"additional-projects/clacks-messages.html":{"url":"additional-projects/clacks-messages.html","title":"Clack Messeges","body":"Clacks Messages - encoding and decoding text messages\n Covert clacks messages into multiple pages\nAt the March 2016 London Clojurians code dojo at uSwitch our group created a Clacks Interpreter in honor of Terry Pratchett, the author of the amazing Discworld series of books (and a few TV shows of those books too).\nIn the 33rd Discworld novel called Going Postal, messages are sent faster than a speeding horse via the Clacks system.  This composes of a series of towers that cross a continent and pass messages on via combinations of lights.  Each tower sees a grid of lights from a distant tower and sends the message on to the next tower.\n\nThe Clacks system was actually introduced in the 24th Discworld novel called &quot;The Fith Elephant&quot;, however its the &quot;Going Postal&quot; book where we learn the full history of the Clacks system.\n\nWe created a Clacks Interpreter that converts any English message into its corresponding clacks signal, based on the Clacks alphabet as defined by the board game of the same name.  The board game defines the alphabet as a 2 by 3 grid (although in the Discworld its actually 8 large squares).  Naturally, the interpreter also converts the Clacks signal back into an English message too.\n\nThe code is available on Github at: https://github.com/liamjtaylor/clacks-messenger and read on for a walk through of how we came up with the solution.\n\nThe Challenge\nWe wanted to be able to take any English language messages and transmit it across the clacks network, then\nRepresenting a Clack\nFor each clack, we read the pattern from the top of the first column to the botton, then from the top of the second column to the bottom.  A light in a position represents a 1 value and no light represents a 0 value.  This gives us our 6 number pattern for each clack in the alphabet.\nDeciding the data structure\nThe initial data structure chosen was essentially just modelling each individual clack.  Since a clack is a 2x3 structure, the simplest way to represent a clacks is to have a vector that contains 2 vectors, each with three elements.\nSo a simple expression of the letter a in the clacks alphabet would be:\n[[0 1 0][0 0 1]]\n\nTherefore we could define a single letter of our alphabet as follows:\n(def a [[0 1 0][0 0 1]])\n\nBefore we define the complete alphabet using this data structure, lets test if we have the right data structure for our conversion process.\nTesting a simple conversion with our data structure\nLets try the simplest way to convert a character into a clack:\n(defn character-&gt;clack [character]\n  (if (= character &quot;a&quot;)\n    a\n    (str &quot;Sorry, character is not yet in the alphabet, please create a pull request&quot;)))\n\nCalling the function converts a string into the corresponding clack\n(character-&gt;clack &quot;a&quot;)\n\nAlthough the code is simple for 1 character, it does hightlight the problem of converting the whole alphabet.  We would need either a deeply nested set of if statements or a very long case statement, neither of which seems to be a particularly functional approach or idiomatic Clojure.\nEven if we did use a case statement, how would we convert a clack back into a character?\nSo perhaps we need to change the data structure, one that provides an easy way to map to values together.\nAlso, there seems no value in mapping values to a 2x3 grid as long as we consistently express a clack.\nDefining the alphabet with a map\nA map data structure in Clojure is a hash map (a key &amp; value paring) for example I could define myself as a map\n{:name &quot;john&quot; :age &quot;21&quot; :twitter &quot;jr0cket&quot;}\n\nIts very common to use Clojure keywords for the keys, to make it easy to look up a particular value by refering to the keyword.\nSo the new design for our clacks data structure is as follows\n{:a [0 1 0 0 0 1]}\n\nTo help with testing this new data structure desing, we crated enough letters of the clacks alphabet to make some simple words, i.e bat\n(def alphabet {:a [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n               :b [0 0 1 0 1 0]\n               :t [1 0 0 1 1 1]})\n\nTesting the map design\nWe can use the keyword to lookup the value of its clack code\n(alphabet :a)\n\n;; =&gt; [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n\nThen we created a simple function to convert a string to a sequence of clacks\n(defn character-&gt;clack [letter]\n  (if (= letter &quot;a&quot;)\n    (alphabet :a)\n    (str &quot;Sorry, character is not yet in the alphabet, please create a pull request&quot;)))\n\n\nThe -&gt; character is part of the function name.  This is a Clojure naming convention used when the function you are defining converts from one type to another.\n\nAnd call the function as follows\n(character-&gt;clack &quot;a&quot;)\n\n;; =&gt; [0 1 0 0 0 1]\n\nConverting a word\nNow we want to convert a whole word to a clacks sequence.  It seemed the easiest way to convert a whole word was to convert each letter at a time using the map to look up each clack code, returning all the clacks codes in a sequence.\nSo we redefined the string-&gt;clacks function to take in a whole word.\nWe used the map function to apply a conversion function over each element in the word (each element of the string).  This conversion function called clacksify.\n(defn clacksify [letter]\n  (let [character (str letter)]\n  (alphabet (keyword character))))\n\n(defn string-&gt;clacks [word]\n  (map clacksify word))\n\nNow we could convert any workd that used the letters of our limted alphabet.  We chose bat as a simple word.\n(string-&gt;clacks &quot;bat&quot;)\n\n\nAs we are passing a string and not a keyword to the clacksify function, then we first convert the string to a keyword using the keyword function.\n\nConverting the clack to a string\nIs there a simple way to look up a key given a value that is unique in the map?\nAll Clack codes are unique in the map, but there did not seem to be a simple expression to find the key when given a value.\nWe could have created a second mapping, however having two maps seemed redundant and a potential cause for silly bugs.\nThe answer was simple once we found it.  As the clack codes are unique, they could be used as keys for the letter values, we just needed to swap the map around.  Swapping a map&apos;s keys and values was done by writing a reverse-map function.\n(defn reverse-map\n  &quot;Reverse the keys and value pairs in a map.\n  Allows the map to be used to convert from a clack to a letter without defining a second map&quot;\n  [m]\n  (into {} (map (fn [[a b]] [b a]) m)))\n\nSo we defined the function declacksify which takes a clack code and returns its corresponding character.  The clack code returns the corresponding keyword rather than a character, so we use the name function to convert the keyword into a character name.\n(defn declacksify [clack]\n  (name ((reverse-map alphabet) clack)))\n\n(defn clacks-&gt;string [clacks]\n  (map declacksify clacks))\n\nSo calling these functions with a clacks\n(declacksify  [1 0 0 1 1 1])\n;; =&gt; &quot;t&quot;\n\n(clacks-&gt;string [[0 0 1 0 1 0] [0 1 0 0 0 1] [1 0 0 1 1 1]])\n;; =&gt; (&quot;b&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;t&quot;)\n\n\nIts probably at this point we should have realised that we didnt need to use keywords to represent the characters of the alphabet.  In fact, using keywords made a little more work for us.\n\nTyding up the output\nOur clacks-&gt;string function returns the right result, but not quite in the format we want.  Rather than a single string, we get the individual characters.\nUsing the reduce function we can apply the str function over the resulting characters to give a single string.  So our function becomes\n(defn clacks-&gt;string [clacks]\n(map str (map declacksify clacks)))\n\nWorking with another language\nThanks to a flexible design with no side effects or side causes then its really easy to replace the English language alphabet with another language that can be encoded into Clack codes.  So languages based on the greek, latin or cyrilic alphabet could be send if a suitable alphabet with clack codes is supplied.\nSummary\nWe were quite happy with the code produced in this dojo.  The code is pretty readable we believe and we have taken a fairly simple approach to the design.  In hindsight we could have made the code even easier if we had tested out the map data structure a little more and used a string character for each letter in the alphabet.\nWorking in an editor attached to a REPL worke well (Vim in this case, but not relevant to the development of the code).  The behaviour of the code was tested with almost every expression, so we gained a good understanding of each line of code.\nThere are ideas to take this further and show a visual representation of a message passing through a chain of clack tower, showing how the message would pass through the system at a human speed.

We could put it in a loop, but then its running the tests all the time and that may use up resources (worth a try though).\nThe following will run tests every 30 seconds\n\n(run-tests)\n\n\nDefine a recent song list\n(def recent-songs [])\n\n Write a test to check a song-list existsWrite a test to see if a recent song list exists.This is an opportunity to think about what kind of data structure you want to use to hold your recent song list.(deftest song-list-exists-test\n  (testing &quot;Does a recent song list exist&quot;\n    (is\n     (vector? recent-songs))))\n\nSuggested test...\nA simple test that checks for a recent-songs list, checking \n(deftest song-list-exists-test\n  (testing &quot;Does a recent song list exist&quot;\n    (is\n     (vector? recent-songs))))\n\n\n Write a test to check the song-list is emptyThe recent song list should be empty to start with.```clojure\n(deftest song-list-empty-test\n  (testing &quot;Is song list empty if we havent added any songs&quot;\n    (is\n     (= [] recent-songs))))\n\nSuggested test...\nA simple test that compares an empty vector with the value of recent-songs\n(deftest song-list-empty-test\n  (testing &quot;Is song list empty if we havent added any songs&quot;\n    (is\n     (= [] recent-songs))))\n\nHere is the same test using the empty? function instead of the = function.\n(deftest song-list-empty-test-2\n  (testing &quot;Is song list empty if we havent added any songs&quot;\n    (is\n     (empty? recent-songs))))\n\n HintYou could use either of these tests to replace the song list exists test, as these tests would fail if the song list did not exist.\n\n Write a test to add a song to the list\nSuggested test...\n(deftest adding-songs-test\n\n  (testing &quot;add song returns a song list with entries&quot;\n    (is\n     (not (empty?\n           (add-song &quot;Barry Manilow - Love on the rocks&quot; recent-songs)))))\n\n  (testing &quot;add multiple song returns a song list with entries&quot;\n    (is\n     (not (empty?\n           (-&gt;&gt; recent-songs\n             (add-song &quot;Barry Manilow - Love on the rocks&quot;)\n             (add-song &quot;Phil Colins - Sususudio&quot; )))))))\n\n\nSuggested Code Solution...\nThis suggested solution defines our recent songs as an empty vector.\nThe add-song function takes the name of a song and the song list to which it will be added.\nA Thread-last macro -&gt;&gt; is used to pass the song list over two functions.\nThe song-list is first passed to the remove expression as its last argument.  This expression will remove any occurrence of the new song we want to add from the song-list.\nThe results of the remove expression are then passed to the cons expressoin as its last argument.  The cons expression simply adds the new song to the start of the list, making it the most recent song.\n(def recent-songs [])\n\n(defn add-song [song song-list]\n  (-&gt;&gt; song-list\n       (remove #(= song %))\n       (cons song)))\n\n\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };

Functional Programming concepts\nCode challenges (exercises for students)\n\nFeedback on: \n\nhow well any concepts are explained\nhow simple the code examples are to follow\nif code challenges are clear, to easy or to challenging\n\nPlease ask about contributing at the #clojurebridge-london channel on the Clojurians Slack community.  \n\nUse the Clojurians.net slackbot for an invite if you do not have a login account for the Clojurians Slack community.\n\nHow to Contribute\nYou can either add or edit content directly on the ClojureBridge Workshop Github repository or fork that repository and make changes with your favourite editor and submit a pull request.\nAll content is in markdown files, ending with a file extension of .md.\nAll content is in English with UK spelling, except in some code snippets that use Americanised words (eg. color).\nCreating a local environment\nThe Workshop uses Gitbook to create the website content (html, css, javascript) from the markdown pages.  \nYou can run your own Gitbook server to see what your changes look like before making a commit.\nInstall Node.js\nGitbook requires Node.js and recommends version 6.11.x or greater\nThe Node.js website  has installation instructions.  To test you have nodejs working, run the command node -v\nInstall Gitbook\nInstall Gitbook npm package globally (where-ever nodejs itself is installed) using the command\nnpm install gitbook-cli -g\n\n\nIf the above fails because nodejs is installed in a protected area of your filespace, you will need to install gitbook as administrator using the following command instead sudo npm install gitbook-cli -g\n\nClone the Workshop content\nUse git to download a local copy of the workshop content to your local machine.  For example:\ngit clone https://github.com/ClojureBridgeLondon/workshop-content-gitbook.git\n\nInstall Gitbook plugins\nOnce downloaded, change into the workshop-content-gitbook directory and run the following command to install the supporting plugins for Gitbook\ngitbook install\n\nDo not run gitbook install as administrator, only your normal user account.  These plugins are installed locally in a folder called node-modules inside the workshop-content-gitbook directory.\n Do not run gitbook initPlease do not run gitbook init inside the workshop-content-gitbook directory or it will updated the navigation and add a second readme.md file.\nRunning Gitbook locally\nGitbook will run a local webserver on port :4000 using the command:\ngitbook serve\n\nView the website using http://localhost:4000\nMaking changes\nEdit or create new files and once you save changes the website will automatically update.\nChanging the Navigation\nThe navigation is defined in the file SUMMARY.md.\nEach line in this file creates a link in the left hand side navigation of the Gitbook website.  The syntax is [Link name](/path/to/file.md).\nNested pages of the navigation are defined by inserting 4 space characters at the start of a line.  There can be several levels of nesting.\nA style guide for the navigation is to create a directory and index.md file for each section and contain all the markdown files under that section in that directory.\nContributing changes\nPlease create a pull request on the ClojureBridge Workshop Github repository.\nThank you.\n@jr0cket\n       window.klipse_settings = {         selector: \".language-klipse, .lang-eval-clojure\",         selector_eval_js: \".lang-eval-js\",         selector_eval_python_client: \".lang-eval-python\",         selector_eval_php: \".lang-eval-php\",         selector_eval_scheme: \".lang-eval-scheme\",         selector_eval_ruby: \".lang-eval-ruby\",         selector_reagent: \".lang-reagent\",        selector_google_charts: \".lang-google-chart\",        selector_es2017: \".lang-eval-es2017\",        selector_jsx: \".lang-eval-jsx\",        selector_transpile_jsx: \".lang-transpile-jsx\",        selector_render_jsx: \".lang-render-jsx\",        selector_react: \".lang-react\",        selector_eval_markdown: \".lang-render-markdown\",        selector_eval_lambdaway: \".lang-render-lambdaway\",        selector_eval_cpp: \".lang-eval-cpp\",        selector_eval_html: \".lang-render-html\",        selector_sql: \".lang-eval-sql\",        selector_brainfuck: \"lang-eval-brainfuck\",        selector_js: \".lang-transpile-cljs\"    };  "}}}
